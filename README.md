COMCEPT OF HEAP-SORT :--

Heap Sort works by first creating a special binary tree called Heap. Heap has largest element in top so it works in the reverse order.

1. Remove the topmost item (the largest) and replace it with the rightmost leaf. The topmost item is stored in an array.

2. Re-establish the heap.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more items left in the heap.

The sorted elements are now stored in an array.
